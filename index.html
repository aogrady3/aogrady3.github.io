            <h2>Road to Engineering</h2>
            <p>Prior to my time as a Software Engineer, I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology and a concentration in pre-medical studies with plans of entering medical school. I worked alongside Emergency Room Physicians in St. John’s ER, caring for patients, and coordinating with Emergency Personnel. It was during this time that my passion for medicine dwindle. I found myself craving an environment which involved more creative thinking, dynamic problem solving, and collaboration among co-workers. </p>
            <p>I would soon leave a career in medicine, and enroll in Fordham University's Masters program in Computer Science. During my time in my masters program I was able to create, design, and implement software for differing applications. Soon after I was hired in Fordham University’s IT department as a Project Manager, where I managed projects that drove innovation among the student and faculty populations. This often included managing the roll out of new applications, transforming classrooms into innovative tech environments, or upgrading existing technologies within the IT department.</p>
            <p>Currently I am a Fullstack Developer and Software Engineer. I have received my Masters in Computer Science as of December 2019 from Fordham University. I have a passion for creating unique applications that leverage new technologies. I enjoy being challenged with engaging projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set. I am skilled with various technologies including Node.js, Javascript, SQL, noSQL, Python, Java, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, React, Redux, Express.js, Passport.js, Git, Github, Webpack, Babel, and much more!</p>

                In Good Company is a social networking application where Users can create their own personalized social network! In Good Company’s front-end consists primarily of React, Apollo Client, Material UI, and CSS. Modular React components allowed for easy design implementation throughout. Personal CSS contributed to most of the UI/UX of the site.
                In Good Company’s back-end consists primarily of Node.js, Prisma (ORM, Database, Server), and GraphQl. The backend of our application was handled by Prisma, which provided us with a database, ORM, and server. GraphQl replaced the typical RESTful architecture, by providing a single endpoint to mutate and query data from our database. Heroku was used for deployment of our app.

                LeakSpeak was awarded 1st place overall at Microsoft's Gotham DLT Hackaton and 1st place for Brooklyn Law Incubator & Policy Clinic challenge. 
                The application aims to to advance environmental, economic, or social justice through the use of blockchain technology to provide a streamline process for global issues to be easily communicated. LeakSpeak allows journalists to anonymously reward their sources for their information and protects information from censorship by hosting the data on a non-custodial, decentralized network. In the era of fake news, leakSpeak is a way to get on the ground information and to prevent the rewriting of history. We hope leakSpeak will inspire a new wave of citizen journalism and awareness.

                React Native Mobile Application, which allows users to rent their personal driveways! Growing up in the Bronx I have always had trouble parking or finding available spots. Whether it be looking for parking by the 6 train or visiting family I always noticed a lack of street parking but tons of empty driveways. After being confronted with this problem on countless occasions I created the mobile application Easy Spot, a mobile application that allows users to rent their personal driveways!
