            <h2>Road to Engineering</h2>
            <p>Prior to my time as a Software Engineer, I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Psychology and a concentration in pre-medical studies in hopes of entering medical school. I worked alongside Emergency Room Physicians in St.John’s ER, caring for patients, and coordinating with Emergency Personnel. It was during this time that my passion for medicine dwindle. I found myself craving an environment which involved more creative thinking, dynamic problem solving, and collaboration among co-workers. </p>
            <p>I would soon leave a career in medicine, and enroll in Fordham University's Masters program in Computer Science. During my time in my masters program my creativity and technical skills would flourish being able to create, design, and implement software for differing applications .Soon after I would be hired in Fordham University’s IT department as a Project Manager, where I would manage projects that drove innovation among the student and faculty populations. This often included managing the roll out of new applications, transforming classrooms into innovative tech environments, or upgrading existing technologies within the IT department.</p>
            <p>Currently I am Fullstack Developer and Software Engineer. I have received my Masters in Computer Science as of December 2019 from Fordham University. I have a passion for creating unique applications that leverage new technologies. I enjoy being challenged with engaging projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set. I am skilled with various technologies including Node.js, Javascript, SQL, noSQL, Python, Java, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, React, Redux, Express.js, Passport.js, Git, Github, Webpack, Babel, and much more!</p>
